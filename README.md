# Finance-and-Risk-Analytics

As a data scientist, your task is to analyse the provided financial data and develop a predictive model using
machine learning techniques to identify whether a company will be tagged as a defaulter based on its net
worth next year. A company will be considered a defaulter if its net worth next year is negative; otherwise, it
will not be tagged as a defaulter. This predictive model will help anticipate potential challenges in the financial
performance of companies and enable proactive risk mitigation strategies.


The FRA project consists of two parts. Part A focuses on default prediction and financial analysis, aiming to assess a company's ability to meet its debt obligations. Part B involves market risk analysis, where the mean and std deviation of stock returns are calculated to gain insights into stock performance and volatility. These analyses are valuable tools for investors, financial institutions, and stakeholders in making informed decisions related to creditworthiness and investment strategies.
